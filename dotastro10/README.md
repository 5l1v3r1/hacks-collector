MINING THE PAST, MAKING SPACE FOR THE FUTURE

Astronomy is the science of the past and the future of the Universe. For the 10th edition of .Astronomy we will explore this duality of our science in all its guises: we push to build, innovate and explore to study at the same time our history and our future. We apply new technologies to data from past observations to generate new knowledge. The conference venue, the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, is a global centre for space astronomy: the hub of Hubble, and the home of its golden heir, the James Webb Space Telescope. STScI hosts MAST, the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes, which makes data available to the community from numerous other missions and projects, such as Kepler, TESS and Pan-STARRS. We’ll be incorporating the theme of space telescopes into our sessions.

For the conference, we invite you to leave your presentation slides behind, and bring your ideas and enthusiasm to work together to learn from our past and build for the future. The conference starts with "Day Zero": a day of introductions and tutorials. On days 1 and 3, we'll mix talks with unconference sessions, which are led by the participants themselves on topics of their choosing. The Hack Day on day 2 gives room for learning, collaborating and being creative around the themes of the conference - be it technical, cultural or artistic.
