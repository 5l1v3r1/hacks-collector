.Astronomy 11 brings the conference to Canada for the first time! Canada has a rich heritage in astronomy, including the development of Very Long Base Line Interferometry (VLBI), the discovery of Supernova 1987A, and observations of the first known black hole, Cygnus X-1. There is a large community of astronomers in Toronto with interests across both astronomy and software/data issues.
